# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Performed advanced exploratory data analysis on the Superstore Sales Dataset using Python. Cleaned and transformed over 9K records to analyze trends in sales, profit, discounts, and regional performance. Engineered new features like monthly aggregates and profit margins, and visualized insights using matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly.
Conducted statistical hypothesis testing (t-test) to assess the impact of discounts on profitability. Built a linear regression model to forecast monthly sales, achieving an RÂ² of 0.85. Delivered actionable insights such as high-discount regions yielding low profits and seasonal sales dips, providing a foundation for data-driven business decisions.
